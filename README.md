# asic-Data-Visualization-in-Python
 A simple Python project using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the Seaborn tips dataset. Includes a line plot, scatter plot, histogram, and box plot. Inspired by Microsoft Fabric’s data science tutorial. Great for beginners exploring basic data visualization techniques.
✅ Project Summary: Basic Data Visualization in Python
Objective:
# 📊 Basic Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

This project demonstrates simple and effective data visualization techniques using Python's **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** libraries. It explores the real-world `tips` dataset and showcases how to generate common plots for data analysis.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python 3.x  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Pandas  

## 📁 Dataset
The `tips` dataset is included in Seaborn and contains information about restaurant bills, tips, and customer demographics.

## 📌 Features
- **Line Plot** – Visualizes trends in total bills over time  
- **Scatter Plot** – Shows the relationship between total bill and tip  
- **Histogram** – Displays the frequency distribution of total bills  
- **Box Plot** – Compares total bill distributions across different days

## 🖥️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-visualization-matplotlib-seaborn.git
   cd data-visualization-matplotlib-seaborn
